# M4 Pandas Challeng
# Test Update 9/15/24
## Project Overview

This project is part of a data analysis challenge that involves working with a fictional e-commerce dataset. The main goal is to perform data exploration, transformation, and analysis using Python's Pandas library to answer business-related questions. The dataset contains client, order, and product information, and the challenge is divided into several parts.

## Project Breakdown

### Part 1: Data Exploration

In this part, we imported the dataset and explored its structure using Pandas. The tasks involved:
- Viewing column names and gathering basic statistics.
- Answering key questions about item categories, client entries, and order quantities.
- Storing the client IDs of the top 5 clients in a list.

### Part 2: Data Transformation

In this part, we transformed the data for better analysis. Tasks included:
- Calculating the subtotal for each order line.
- Computing the shipping price based on item weight.
- Adding a total price column (subtotal + shipping + tax).
- Calculating line costs and profits for each order.

### Part 3: Work Confirmation

We confirmed our work by verifying that our calculations matched expected values from email receipts. This was done for several specific orders to ensure accuracy.

### Part 4: Summary and Analysis

In this section, we summarized and analyzed the data. Key tasks included:
- Determining how much each of the top 5 clients spent.
- Creating a summary DataFrame that includes total units purchased, shipping costs, revenue, and profits for each client.
- Formatting the monetary columns to display values in millions.
- Sorting the results by total profit in descending order for easy comparison.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: For numerical calculations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code execution and documentation.
- **Git**: For version control.

## Conclusion

This project showcases how to effectively use Pandas for data exploration, transformation, and analysis in a real-world scenario. By breaking down the tasks into manageable steps, we were able to clean and manipulate the dataset, perform calculations, and extract valuable insights for business analysis.
